        "user": "No, but I’ve traveled a lot in Europe. My last trip was to Spain — I loved the food and the relaxed vibe.",

    {
        "user": "We’re both vegetarian, and we love cooking classes — we try to take one in every country we visit.",
        "agent": "That’s awesome! Would you prefer hotels or more local stays like guesthouses or Airbnbs?"

        "user": "Probably a mix. We like comfort but also enjoy places with a local feel — nothing too touristy if we can help it.",
